Background story: 
Imagine, One person is going to invest X $. There are two options: 
- put money on the deposit at any well-known bank and have r % annual return which equals to the interest rate in that country. 
- lend money to a new growing business and have R % annual return (R>r). 
Second option brings higher return but involves taking some risk in case of business bankruptcy. 
After investigating information about the start-up business and its founders, the person has figured out that default of that growing company is very unlikely, so it's really a good opportunity to make such investment to have extra return comparing to the market interest rate. 
So, the second option has been chosen. 
Investment details: 
1. Interest rate is R % per year. 
2. A borrower should return his debt as fixed payment each month. Monthly payment doesn't change each month and represents the sum of two components: part of initial principal and interest amount. 
3. Interest amount is calculated on the outstanding principal amount. 
4. Investment duration is N years (it means last refund payment should be done in N years 
after making the investment) 

The task: 
Write a module (i.e. several functions with same prefix) that takes: Agreement date, Calculation date, X, R and N as input data and calculates Sum of all future interest payments. 
Code requirements/restrictions: 
• You can use any programming language you familiar with (but APL/C# is a plus) 
• The code should follow maintainability principals. 
• There should be well defined single-entry point (interface) in the code that takes input argument and returns the result.
